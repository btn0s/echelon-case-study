# Why I Build

As far back as I can remember, I've been building. It started with curiosity—wanting to understand how things actually worked, not just use them. What's underneath. What makes it go.

I grew up watching "How It's Made" with my grandpa, and Animal Planet, and anything else that pulled back the curtain. I was fascinated by Indiana Jones and the idea that ancient civilizations had built these impossible things—how did they do that? What were the mechanisms? I had visual encyclopedias that broke down the technology of Star Wars, or the gadgets Spider-Man villains used. Obviously fake, but I didn't care. I just wanted to understand the systems.

That curiosity turned into making things. I built Lego sets that let me recreate hidden tech from the movies I watched. I made little movies of my own. My grandpa taught me how to code MS-DOS games when I was really young, and I'd build these tiny text-based RPGs—three or four questions long—but that was the start. That was the feeling I kept chasing.

I'm the oldest sibling. Growing up, that meant looking out for people. Carrying some of the weight so they didn't have to. Helping them feel like they could handle things, even when it was hard. That stuck with me—not just in my family, but in every team I've been on since.

Today I bring all of that with me. The tools have changed—now it's design and engineering—but the impulse is the same. I want to understand how things work, and I want to turn that into something useful for someone else.

The best feedback isn't praise. It's when someone uses what I made and just keeps going. The next step is obvious. They feel capable. They don't need me in the room.

That's what I'm building toward.
