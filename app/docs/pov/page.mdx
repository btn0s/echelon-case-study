# Why I Build

I think it all started in my grandpa's chair. We'd watch "How It's Made" or Animal Planet—shows that talked about the how and why of the world. I'd watch movies like Indiana Jones and wonder how ancient civilizations built these impossible things. How did they do it? That question became a habit.

I didn't just watch how things worked. I tried to make things work. Play was never passive for me. It was building with Legos until the thing in my head existed. It was making little movies with toys and problem-solving my way through a scene. It was video games—exploring, escaping, and learning how simple rules turn into emergent systems.

My introduction to technology came from my other grandpa. He taught me how to make text-based games in the command line when I was really young. Later, it was customizing my friends' MySpace pages. That was the start of building for other people.

I'm the oldest sibling. Growing up, that meant looking out for people. Stepping in. Figuring it out. If something went wrong, I was the one finding the next step. Carrying the weight—because someone needed me to. So someone else could move. Helping them feel like they could handle things, even when it was hard. That stuck with me—not just in my family, but in every team I've been on since.

The tools have changed—now it's design and engineering—but the impulse is the same: understand what's underneath, then make it usable. I think of it as toolmaking—builders making things for other builders.

I build to learn. I build so others can move. Sometimes it's both at once—figuring something out while making the path clearer for someone else.

That's why I build.
