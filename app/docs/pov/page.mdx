# Why I Build

As far back as I can remember, I've been building. It started with curiosity—wanting to understand how things actually worked, not just use them. What's underneath. What makes it go.

I think it all started from my grandpa's chair. He'd always have "How It's Made" or Animal Planet on—shows that talked about the how and why of the world. From an early age, I got to see behind the curtain. And I wanted more. I read history books, encyclopedias, anything I could find. I watched movies like Indiana Jones and wondered how ancient civilizations built these impossible things. How did they do that? What were the mechanisms?

I learned creativity through play—building with Legos, making little movies with toys. Video games let me explore, escape, problem-solve. They showed me emergent systems, and that shaped how I think about design.

My introduction to technology came from my grandpa (other grandpa). He taught me how to make text-based games using Windows command prompt in MS-DOS when I was really young. Later it was customizing my friends' MySpace pages. That was the start of something.

I'm the oldest sibling. Growing up, that meant looking out for people. Carrying some of the weight so someone else could move. Helping them feel like they could handle things, even when it was hard. That stuck with me—not just in my family, but in every team I've been on since.

Today I bring all of that with me. The tools have changed—now it's design and engineering—but the impulse is the same. I want to understand how things work and make that useful for someone else. It's the oldest impulse there is. I feel part of that quiet tradition: builders making things for other builders.

I build to learn. I build so others can move. Sometimes it's both at once—figuring something out while making the path clearer for someone else.

That's what I'm building toward.
