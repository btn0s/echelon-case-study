## TL;DR

We're validating that heat creates meaningful tension without feeling frustrating or arbitrary. Does escalating tension create pressure without frustration?

## Key Questions

- **Do players perceive a cause→effect chain from noise → heat → response?**  
  If players don't understand why heat rises, the system feels arbitrary and unfair.

- **Do thresholds feel like escalation, not arbitrary punishment?**  
  Heat thresholds (25, 50, 75, 100) must feel like natural progression, not sudden spikes.

- **What is the best feedback channel: UI meter, audio, lighting, guard barks?**  
  Players need clear feedback about heat level. Multiple channels may be needed for clarity.

- **Are heat source values correct for pacing (footsteps/gunshots/explosions)?**  
  GDD specifies values (+1, +5, +15, +25, +35). These must create the right pacing.

- **Does decay work, and when should it pause?**  
  GDD: '-1 per second when no guards investigating'. This affects pacing significantly.

- **Should thresholds be fixed, stochastic, or context-sensitive?**  
  Fixed thresholds may feel predictable. Stochastic may feel unfair. Need to validate.

## Hypothesis

Heat system with GDD-specified values (+1 footsteps, +15 gunshots, +35 explosions) and fixed thresholds (25, 50, 75, 100) creates meaningful tension. Players will understand cause-effect relationships through clear feedback channels (UI meter + audio cues).

## Experiment Design

Create a test scenario where players can generate noise (footsteps, gunshots, explosions). We'll test:

- Heat calculation with GDD values
- Threshold-based events (guard spawns, Super)
- Heat decay behavior
- Player feedback mechanisms

**Validation method:** Players make noise and observe heat rise. Do they understand cause-effect? Do thresholds feel fair? Does heat create tension without frustration?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Heat progression rate
- Player understanding (do they connect actions to heat?)
- Threshold event timing
- Decay behavior

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- Heat creates meaningful pressure
- Players understand cause-effect relationship
- Heat feels fair (not arbitrary)
- Threshold events create tension escalation
- Heat meter UI is clear and informative

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: final heat values, threshold spacing, decay rate, and feedback channel choices.

## Open Questions

- Should thresholds be fixed, stochastic, or context-sensitive?
- What's the best feedback channel combination?
- When should decay pause?

## Integration Notes

This POC connects to:

- **POC 1: Destruction** - Destruction events trigger heat (explosions +35, wall breaking +25)
- **POC 3: AI Guards** - Heat thresholds spawn guards (2 at 0-25, 4 at 25-50, 6 at 50-75)
- **POC 5: Economy** - Stealth bonus (Heat < 50) rewards +100 credits
- **POC 6: Super Encounter** - Heat 100 triggers Super spawn
