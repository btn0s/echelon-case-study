## TL;DR

We're validating that objectives create real cooperation, not just parallel solo tasks. Does the 10s terminal hack create real co-op tension?

## Key Questions

- **Does the 10s terminal hack create real co-op tension (one hacks, one covers)?**  
  The GDD requires 'both players vulnerable' during hack. If it's solo-able, cooperation fails.

- **Are there moments where players must coordinate under pressure?**  
  Cooperation pillar requires 'teammate is your lifeline'. If players can solo everything, it's not co-op.

- **Does splitting up ever feel optimal, and is that okay for the fantasy?**  
  If splitting up is always optimal, cooperation becomes parallel solo play.

- **Do secondary objectives create real dilemmas (time vs heat vs reward)?**  
  GDD: 'objectives are dilemmas'. If they're just checkboxes, cooperation fails.

- **What interruptions are allowed (pause hack progress vs reset)?**  
  Hack interruption behavior affects tension. Too forgiving = no tension. Too harsh = frustration.

- **Are objectives understandable without reading docs?**  
  Players shouldn't need to read docs to understand objectives. UI/UX must be clear.

## Hypothesis

Terminal hack requiring both players (10s channel, both vulnerable) creates genuine cooperation moments. Secondary objectives with quiet/loud path dilemmas create meaningful tradeoffs that split team attention.

## Experiment Design

Create test scenarios with terminal hack and secondary objectives. We'll test:

- Terminal hack mechanic (10s channel, both vulnerable)
- Secondary objectives (vault, data extraction, evidence)
- Objective UI/UX clarity
- Cooperation requirements

**Validation method:** Players attempt objectives. Do they coordinate? Does terminal hack create tension? Do secondary objectives create dilemmas?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Coordination frequency (do players work together?)
- Objective completion rates
- Player understanding (do they know what to do?)
- Time spent on objectives

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- Objectives create meaningful cooperation
- Terminal hack creates tension (both players vulnerable)
- Players want to coordinate strategy
- Secondary objectives create interesting tradeoffs
- Objective UI communicates status clearly

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: final objective designs, interruption behavior, and UI/UX choices.

## Open Questions

- Should hack progress save on interruption or reset?
- Do secondary objectives create real dilemmas?
- Is splitting up ever optimal?

## Integration Notes

This POC connects to:

- **POC 3: AI Guards** - Guards patrol near objectives, terminal hack makes both players vulnerable
- **POC 5: Economy** - Completed objectives reward credits (+100 each)
- **POC 7: Mission Flow** - Mission success requires objective completion
