## TL;DR

We're validating that all systems work together cohesively to create a fun, polished experience. Which system interaction is most fragile?

## Key Questions

- **Which system interaction is most fragile (heat↔AI, destruction↔sync, economy↔tools)?**  
  System interactions create edge cases. We need to identify the most fragile ones.

- **What is the minimal 'polish set' required to sell the fantasy (audio/UI/juice)?**  
  Demo scope is 4 weeks. We need to identify minimum viable polish.

## Hypothesis

All POC systems integrate smoothly with minimal edge cases. System interactions (heat↔AI, destruction↔sync, economy↔tools) are robust. Minimal polish set (audio/UI/juice) sells the fantasy effectively.

## Experiment Design

Integrate all POC systems into single game loop. We'll test:

- System interactions and edge cases
- Balance across all systems
- UI/UX polish
- Audio/visual polish
- Complete mission flow

**Validation method:** Play through complete integrated demo. Do systems work together? Are there edge cases? Does it feel polished? Do players want "one more run"?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Edge case frequency
- System interaction bugs
- Player engagement (retry rate)
- Performance across all systems

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- All systems work together cohesively
- Core game loop feels fun and tense
- No major bugs or edge cases
- Polish level appropriate for demo
- Players want to "try one more run"
- Case study documentation is complete

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: final system balance, polish choices, and key learnings from the entire development process.

## Open Questions

- Which system interaction is most fragile?
- What's the minimal polish set required?
- Are there any fundamental issues we missed?

## Integration Notes

This POC integrates all previous POCs:

- **POC 0: Multiplayer Foundation** - Networking enables all cooperative gameplay
- **POC 1: Destruction** - Environmental interactions sync across clients
- **POC 2: Heat System** - Tension mechanic drives escalation
- **POC 3: AI Guards** - Opposition responds to player actions
- **POC 4: Co-op Objectives** - Goals require cooperation
- **POC 5: Economic Pressure** - Choices create meaningful decisions
- **POC 6: Super Encounter** - Climax moment creates drama
- **POC 7: Mission Flow** - Complete game loop ties everything together
