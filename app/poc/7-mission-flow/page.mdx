# POC 7: Mission Flow & Lobby

## TL;DR

We're validating that the complete mission flow creates an engaging game loop. Does the loop create distinct phases?

## Key Questions

- **Does the loop create distinct phases (plan → execute → chaos → escape), or does it blur?**  
  The GDD describes distinct mission phases. If they blur together, the fantasy of 'careful plans meet chaos' is lost.

- **What's the minimum fun version of a run in 6–8 minutes?**  
  Demo scope targets 4-week development. We need to validate the shortest engaging experience.

- **Do players understand 'quiet vs loud' and feel it as a meaningful choice?**  
  This is the core dilemma. If players don't perceive the tradeoff, the game's tension evaporates.

- **What is the primary failure mode (death? time? resources?) and does it feel fair?**  
  Failure must feel like player error, not arbitrary punishment. GDD emphasizes 'fair but consequential'.

- **What failure modes must be handled (disconnect mid-hack, mid-escape)?**  
  Co-op games fail if disconnects break the experience. We need graceful degradation.

## Hypothesis

Complete mission flow (pre-mission shop → mission start → execution → extraction → results) creates distinct phases that players recognize. The loop feels engaging and supports "one more run" mentality.

## Experiment Design

Build complete mission flow from lobby to results screen. We'll test:

- Pre-mission shop integration
- Mission start flow
- Extraction mechanics
- Win/lose condition handling
- Mission end screen

**Validation method:** Play through complete mission cycle. Do phases feel distinct? Do players want to start another run? Does the flow feel engaging?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Mission cycle time
- Retry rate
- Phase transition clarity
- Player understanding of flow

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- Complete mission flow feels engaging from start to finish
- Pre-mission shop integrates seamlessly with economy
- Extraction creates final tension moments
- Win/lose conditions are clear and fair
- Mission end screen provides satisfying feedback
- Players want to start another mission immediately

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: final mission flow design, extraction mechanics, and win/lose condition handling.

## Open Questions

- Do both players need to reach extraction?
- What happens if one player dies before extraction?
- Is there an extraction timer?

## Integration Notes

This POC integrates:

- **POC 0: Multiplayer Foundation** - Lobby and matchmaking depend on networking
- **POC 4: Co-op Objectives** - Mission success requires objective completion
- **POC 5: Economy** - Pre-mission shop and credit rewards
- **All POCs** - Complete game loop brings everything together
