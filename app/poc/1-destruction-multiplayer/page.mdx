## TL;DR

We're validating that destruction can feel strategic and sync reliably across multiple players. Can we make the environment feel like a toolkit, not just backdrop?

## Key Questions

- **What destruction granularity is fun and performant (chunks vs pre-broken)?**  
  Granularity affects both gameplay feel and performance. Wrong choice breaks the demo.

- **What is the minimal destructible set for the demo (walls only vs floors)?**  
  Demo scope: 'one room with destructible elements'. We need to define what's destructible.

- **How do we sync 'destruction events' so clients agree on the world?**  
  Desync breaks immersion. Players must see the same world state.

- **Do physics mishaps create laughs without breaking trust?**  
  GDD tone: 'serious characters, silly situations'. Physics should be funny but not frustrating.

- **Is destruction readable and controllable enough to be 'strategy,' not random?**  
  Destruction must feel like a toolkit, not chaos. Players need to predict outcomes.

## Hypothesis

Destruction can feel strategic (readable, controllable) and sync reliably across multiple clients using event-based synchronization. Pre-broken chunks provide the best balance of performance and gameplay feel for our demo scope.

## Experiment Design

Create a minimal test scenario: a single room with destructible walls. Two players can trigger destruction via explosives or impacts. We'll test:

- Physics engine integration (Cannon.js vs Rapier)
- Destruction granularity (voxel vs chunks vs pre-broken)
- State synchronization approach (event-based vs snapshot)
- Performance with simultaneous destructions
- Debris cleanup strategy

**Validation method:** Two players destroy walls simultaneously. Do both see the same result? Does it feel satisfying? Does performance remain acceptable?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Frame rate during destruction events
- Network message count and size
- State consistency checks (do clients agree on world state?)
- Player feedback (does destruction feel satisfying?)

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- Two players can destroy walls and see changes sync smoothly
- Destruction feels satisfying
- Performance remains acceptable with multiple destructions
- State stays consistent across clients
- No visible desync issues

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: which physics engine we chose and why, what destruction granularity works best, and how we're syncing state.

## Open Questions

- Should destruction be deterministic or event-based?
- How do we handle destruction that happens during network lag?
- What's the minimum destructible set for the demo?

## Integration Notes

This POC enables:

- **POC 2: Heat System** - Destruction events trigger heat (explosions +35, wall breaking +25)
- **POC 3: AI Guards** - Guards investigate destruction sites
- **POC 6: Super Encounter** - Super breaks through walls, creating new paths
