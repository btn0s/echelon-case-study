# POC 5: Economic Pressure

## TL;DR

We're validating that economic constraints create interesting choices without feeling punitive. Can players make an agonizing loadout choice with only ~200 credits?

## Key Questions

- **Can players make an agonizing loadout choice with only ~200 credits?**  
  The GDD's 'Pre-Mission Dilemma' requires this choice to feel impossible. If it's easy, the pillar fails.

- **Are rewards/costs tuned so that 'one more run' feels rational, not grindy?**  
  Success criteria: 'Players want to try one more run'. This requires economic balance.

- **Does Strike 2 (+25% costs) meaningfully change behavior, or just annoy?**  
  Strike 2 should create tension, not frustration. Players should adapt strategy, not quit.

- **Do players accept 'FIRED' as dramatic stakes, or reject it as punitive?**  
  Strike 3 resets everything. This must feel dramatic, not unfair.

- **What information do players need after failure to feel 'I can do better next run'?**  
  Failure must feel learnable. Players need clear feedback on what went wrong.

## Hypothesis

GDD-specified credit values (starting ~200, rewards +100/+200) create meaningful loadout choices. Three-strike failure system creates dramatic stakes without feeling punitive. Strike 2 (+25% costs) meaningfully changes player behavior.

## Experiment Design

Create pre-mission shop with three loadout options. We'll test:

- Credit balance and rewards
- Loadout choice difficulty
- 3-strike failure system impact
- Persistence between missions

**Validation method:** Players face loadout choices with limited credits. Do they deliberate? After failures, do they want to retry? Does Strike 2 change behavior?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Loadout choice time
- Credit balance after missions
- Retry rate after failures
- Behavior changes at Strike 2

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- Economic constraints create interesting decisions
- Loadout choices feel meaningful
- Failure feels consequential but not punitive
- Players want to optimize loadouts based on strategy
- Credit balance supports replayability

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: final credit values, loadout costs, and strike system tuning.

## Open Questions

- Should credits persist between sessions?
- Do strikes reset after success or only on failure?
- Are loadout costs balanced with effectiveness?

## Integration Notes

This POC connects to:

- **POC 4: Co-op Objectives** - Completed objectives reward credits (+100 each)
- **POC 2: Heat System** - Stealth bonus (Heat < 50) rewards +100 credits
- **POC 7: Mission Flow** - Pre-mission shop and credit rewards
- **POC 1: Destruction** - Equipment costs affect destruction strategy
