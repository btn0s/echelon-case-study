# POC 6: Super Encounter

## TL;DR

We're validating that the Super encounter feels exciting and memorable, not frustrating. Does the Super feel like a climax, not a chore?

## Key Questions

- **Does the Super feel like a climax, not a chore?**  
  Super is the dramatic peak. If it feels like a chore, the climax fails.

- **Can players escape reliably with skill, and does it feel earned?**  
  Super should be escapable with skill. If it's random, it feels unfair.

- **Is stun satisfying and scarce enough to be strategic?**  
  Stun requires explosives (expensive). It must feel like a meaningful choice, not spam.

## Hypothesis

Super spawn at heat 100 with dramatic entrance (breaks through wall), chase mechanics targeting nearest player, and stun system (explosives, 3-second stun) creates a memorable climax moment. Players can escape reliably with skill.

## Experiment Design

Create Super encounter triggered at heat 100. We'll test:

- Dramatic entrance (breaks through wall)
- Chase behavior (targets nearest player)
- Physics knockback attacks
- Stun mechanic (explosives, 3-second stun)
- Escape conditions

**Validation method:** Trigger Super encounter. Do players feel excitement or frustration? Can skilled players escape? Does stun feel satisfying?

## Instrumentation

What we're measuring:

- Escape success rate
- Stun usage frequency
- Player emotional response
- Chase duration

## Results

*This section will be updated as we implement the POC.*

### Success Criteria

- Super feels threatening and memorable
- Chase creates tension and excitement
- Players can escape (not impossible)
- Stun mechanic feels satisfying to use
- Entrance feels dramatic and impactful
- Encounter doesn't feel frustrating or unfair

## Decision

*This section will document our decision once we complete the POC.*

Once we complete testing, we'll document: Super behavior design, chase mechanics, stun system, and escape conditions.

## Open Questions

- How should Super pathfind (through walls vs around obstacles)?
- Can stuns be chained, or should there be a cooldown?
- What are the exact escape conditions?

## Integration Notes

This POC connects to:

- **POC 2: Heat System** - Super spawns at heat 100 (climax of all tension)
- **POC 1: Destruction** - Super breaks through walls, creating new paths
- **POC 3: AI Guards** - All guards become aggressive when Super spawns
- **POC 5: Economy** - Stun requires explosives (economy system)
- **POC 4: Co-op Objectives** - Super chases players, affecting objective completion
