# btn0s Tone Guide (v1)

## What this guide is for

Use this to make your writing:

- **More consistent** (same voice across posts)
- **More intentional** (pick the right mode for the goal)
- **More transferable** (readers can act, not just agree)

This is a working document. Update it as you ship more writing.

## Positioning (the lane)

**I build tools and game-like systems that create momentum for other people.**  
Not “content”, not “hot takes”. Clear paths. Clean handoffs. Doors that are already open.

If you need a sharper sentence:

- **Design engineer with game-design instincts:** I care about interaction feel, clarity, stakes, feedback loops, and the invisible infrastructure that makes systems trustworthy.

---

## Non‑negotiables (voice rules)

- **Clarity over cleverness.** Prefer the plain sentence that lands.
- **Purpose over performance.** No hype, no chest-thumping, no “thought leadership”.
- **Show the thinking.** Decisions earn trust when you expose tradeoffs.
- **Teach, don’t document.** Write like you’re explaining to a smart builder new to the domain.
- **Be specific.** Name the game, name the failure mode, name the constraint.
- **Quiet confidence.** Let the craft speak; you don’t need to announce it.

---

## Tone knobs (choose deliberately per post)

Dial these up/down before you write the first sentence.

- **Immediacy** (how fast readers get value)
  - Low: reflective essays, ethos pieces
  - High: tutorials, “how I built X”, recipes
- **Rigor** (how explicit your reasoning + tradeoffs are)
  - Low: gallery posts, lightweight notes
  - High: system design, networking, economy, AI behaviors
- **Poetry** (metaphor, cadence, fragments)
  - Low: technical docs, reference pages
  - High: “Why I Build” style, manifesto notes
- **Warmth** (direct address, empathy, openness)
  - Low: sterile/academic (avoid)
  - High: “I’m worried. I’m excited.” / “This sounds simple. It is not.”

Rule: **Don’t max all knobs at once.** Pick one primary and one secondary.

## Canonical structures (pick one; don’t freestyle early)

### 1) Systems Case Study (your default technical mode)
Best for: game systems, infrastructure, prototypes, anything with tradeoffs.

**Problem → Options → Decision → Implementation → Results**

Required moves:
- Define the **failure cost** (“get it wrong and players see different worlds”)
- Enumerate 2–3 real options (not strawmen)
- State what’s **out of scope** (protects clarity)
- End with **what we learned** + what changes next

### 2) Builder’s Log (Emil-adjacent: craft + receipts)
Best for: components, micro-interactions, “small detail, big feel”.

**Story → Constraint → Attempt(s) → Fix → Why it matters**

Required moves:
- Show the **before/after** (even if it’s just described)
- Admit the “trial and error” constants (“this number is what I landed on…”)
- Give readers something to steal today (pattern, snippet, heuristic)

### 3) Craft Essay (Rauno-adjacent: distilled principles)
Best for: interaction design principles, taste, “invisible details”.

**A claim → A concrete example → A general rule**

Required moves:
- Sectioned, skimmable headings
- Crisp sentences, minimal backstory
- High signal, low autobiography

### 4) Quiet Manifesto (your philosophical mode)
Best for: identity, motivation, values, “what I’m optimizing for”.

**Origin → Principle → Practice → Invitation**

Required moves:
- Use cadence intentionally (short lines earn emphasis)
- Anchor with 1–2 concrete images or memories (not abstract virtue)
- Land the invitation: “Here’s what I’m trying to build next / for whom”

### 5) Gallery / Catalog (Gavin Nelson-adjacent)
Best for: prototypes, experiments, “look at this motion”.

**One sentence of intent → a list of artifacts**

Required moves:
- A single framing line (why these exist)
- Titles that imply the interaction (“Time Machine scrolling concept”)
- Optional: one line per artifact if readers need context

## Signature phrasing (keep; don’t overuse)

These are “btn0s tells” — use sparingly so they stay sharp.

- “This sounds simple. It is not.”
- “Get it wrong, and …”
- “Not X. Y.”
- “Build something that lets someone else begin.”
- “The invisible infrastructure…”

---

## Anti-patterns (what to cut on sight)

- **Hype verbs**: “crushed”, “insane”, “game-changing”, “revolutionary”
- **Vague claims**: “it’s important”, “it’s interesting”, “it’s powerful”
- **Authority cosplay**: “as we all know”, “obviously”, “clearly”
- **Unpriced opinions**: strong takes without constraints, examples, or tradeoffs
- **Over-fragmentation**: too many poetic fragments without a thesis

### AI tells (cut these too)

**Hedging/throat-clearing:**

- "It's important to note...", "It is worth mentioning..."
- "But it wasn't just X—Y" (over-explains the pivot)

**Grandiose verbs:**

- Delve, Dive into, Embrace, Empower, Foster, Navigate, Unveil, Enhance

**Vague grandeur nouns:**

- Landscape, Realm, Tapestry, Journey (unless literal)

**Overwrought adjectives:**

- Vibrant, Intricate, Meticulous, Cutting-edge, Rapidly evolving

**Cliché openers/phrases:**

- "In this day and age", "At the end of the day", "In the realm of"
- "Picture this", "A testament to...", "Fast-paced world"

**Overused transitions:**

- Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, Consequently, As a result
- "In other words", "In conclusion"

**Structural tells:**

- Repetitive sentence structures (same rhythm, same length)
- Excessive qualification before every claim
- Over-structured (too many numbered lists, too-clean headers)

---

## Specificity checklist (the “make it real” pass)

Before publishing, ensure you have at least:

- **1 named constraint** (latency, budget, time, team size, perf target)
- **1 named failure mode** (desync, jank, unfairness, unclear affordance)
- **2 alternatives** you considered (and why you rejected them)
- **1 reader takeaway** that can be applied elsewhere (pattern / heuristic)

---

## Editing checklist (the “sound like you” pass)

Run this in order:

1. **Cut the ego:** remove self-justification, resume lines, unnecessary flex.
2. **Expose the hinge:** what decision did everything depend on?
3. **Make tradeoffs legible:** add the “cost” of each option.
4. **Tighten the cadence:** keep fragments only where they earn emphasis.
5. **End with momentum:** next step, open question, or invitation.

---

## Hybrid recipe (recommended)

If you want posts to feel more “alive” without losing your lane:

- Open with **your problem statement** (btn0s)
- Write the middle with **progressive disclosure + concrete fixes** (Emil/Josh)
- Use **distilled craft sections** for skimmability (Rauno)
- Close with **purpose + next motion** (btn0s)
