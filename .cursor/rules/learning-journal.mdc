# Learning Journal / POC Case Studies

## Purpose

The `/app/poc/` pages are **educational case studies** that serve as both a learning tool during development and permanent documentation for future reference.

They answer: "If someone (including future me) wants to understand how and why we built X, can they learn it deeply from this page?"

## Philosophy: Narrative Over Template

Each POC page should tell a **story**, not fill a template. Walk the reader through:

1. **The problem** — Why does this matter? What breaks if we get it wrong?
2. **Historical context** — How has the industry solved this? What can we learn from games like Payday, Left 4 Dead, etc.?
3. **The options** — What approaches exist? What are the tradeoffs?
4. **Our thinking** — Why are we choosing this approach for Echelon specifically?
5. **The implementation** — Step-by-step, what do we build? How does the code work?
6. **What we learned** — Results, decisions, lessons for future POCs

Don't force every POC into identical sections. Let the content dictate the structure. A networking POC needs deep explanation of prediction vs interpolation. A UI POC might need more visual examples. Be intentional.

## Content Requirements

Every POC should include, where relevant:

- **The "why"** — Why this matters for Echelon, consequences of getting it wrong
- **History and context** — How real games solved this (Payday 2, L4D2, Deep Rock, etc.)
- **Concept explanations** — Teach the reader, don't assume knowledge
- **Tradeoff analysis** — Options considered, pros/cons, why we chose what we chose
- **Stack-specific guidance** — R3F, pmndrs ecosystem, relevant libraries
- **Real resources** — Links to Gaffer on Games, Wawa Sensei, GDC talks, GitHub repos
- **Code walkthroughs** — Annotated snippets explaining the "why" not just "what"
- **Pitfalls and warnings** — Common mistakes, "things I wish I knew"
- **Open questions** — What we'll discover during implementation

## Our Stack

Keep these in mind when writing implementation guidance:

- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** — 3D rendering
- **Zustand** — Local state management (client-side only)
- **@react-three/rapier** — Physics
- **PartyKit / Socket.io / Colyseus** — Networking options
- **pmndrs ecosystem** — drei, postprocessing, etc.

Find resources from the community:
- [Wawa Sensei tutorials](https://wawasensei.dev/)
- [Gaffer on Games](https://gafferongames.com/)
- [pmndrs GitHub](https://github.com/pmndrs)
- Relevant GDC talks

## Writing Style

- **Teach, don't document** — Write as if explaining to a smart developer new to game dev
- **Tell the story** — "We tried X, but discovered Y, so we chose Z"
- **Be specific** — Name specific games, link specific articles, cite specific patterns
- **Show the thinking** — Why this approach? What alternatives did we reject?
- **Use expandable sections** — `<LearnMore>`, `<Concept>`, `<IndustryExample>`, `<Tradeoffs>`, `<Pitfall>`, `<CodeWalkthrough>` for depth without clutter

## Available MDX Components

Use these to layer depth — readers can skim the main content or expand to learn more:

- `<LearnMore title="...">` — Generic expandable for additional context
- `<Concept title="...">` — Theory explanations
- `<IndustryExample game="..." relevance="...">` — How real games solve this
- `<Tradeoffs title="...">` — Comparison tables and analysis
- `<Pitfall title="..." severity="warning|critical">` — Warnings and gotchas
- `<CodeWalkthrough title="...">` — Annotated code with explanation

## Perplexity Deep Dive Links

Use the `<PerplexityLink>` component to add "dive deeper" links for any concept worth exploring:

```mdx
<PerplexityLink query="client side prediction multiplayer games how it works" />
```

Add these inline after introducing a concept. Use specific, targeted queries:

- Good: `client side prediction multiplayer games how it works`
- Bad: `networking` (too vague)

Optional: customize the link text with children:

```mdx
<PerplexityLink query="GGPO rollback netcode">learn about rollback</PerplexityLink>
```

This lets readers instantly research any topic without leaving the flow.
