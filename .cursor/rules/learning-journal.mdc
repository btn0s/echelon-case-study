# Learning Journal / POC Case Studies

## Purpose

The `/app/poc/` pages teach through story. They answer: "If someone wants to understand how and why we built X, can they learn it deeply from this page?"

These are case studies, not documentation. The reader should understand the problem, the constraints, the tradeoffs, and why we chose what we chose.

## The Point

Each POC tells a story about a decision. Not every decision needs the same structure. A networking POC might focus on prediction vs interpolation. A UI POC might need visual examples. Let the content guide the structure.

What matters:

- **Why this matters** — What breaks if we get it wrong? Name the failure mode.
- **The constraints** — Time, performance, complexity, team size. What limited our options?
- **The tradeoffs** — What alternatives did we reject? Why?
- **The implementation** — How does it work? Show the code, explain the "why" not just the "what".
- **What we learned** — What would we do differently? What remains open?

## Writing Style

Write as if explaining to a capable peer new to game dev. Teach, don't document.

- Name specific games, link specific articles, cite specific patterns
- Show the thinking: "We tried X, but discovered Y, so we chose Z"
- State what was rejected or left rough
- End with what changed or what remains open

## Stack Context

When writing implementation guidance, prefer popular, well-maintained libraries that solve the problem well. Research what's widely used in 2025, check GitHub stars, community activity, and documentation quality. Name specific libraries when they're relevant to the decision, but don't prescribe a fixed stack.

Reference community resources when they're useful:
- Tutorials and guides from active maintainers
- Foundational articles (Gaffer on Games, etc.)
- GDC talks and conference presentations
- Well-documented open source projects

## MDX Components

Use these components to layer depth without clutter:

- `<AccordionSection title="...">` — Expandable sections for additional context, historical background, detailed explanations
- `<Alert title="...">` — Important warnings, notes, or critical information
- `<PerplexityLink query="...">` — Deep dive links for concepts worth exploring further

## Perplexity Links

Add `<PerplexityLink>` after introducing concepts worth exploring:

```mdx
<PerplexityLink query="client side prediction multiplayer games how it works" />
```
